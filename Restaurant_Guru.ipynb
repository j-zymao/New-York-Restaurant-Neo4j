    "When we use Yelp to find restaurants to eat or order deliveries, there is always important information missing on a business’s information page. This is because the customers or the merchants enter restaurant information by themselves. For instance, phone numbers, opening hours, and parking availability are sometimes the missing information that might cause merchants to lose customers, especially in a difficult time like COVID. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our company, “The Restaurant Guru,” specializes in recording different aspects of a restaurant in detail to benefit merchants and customers. We have employees who will personally visit a restaurant to regularly record and update important information to the most accurate restaurant details. \n",
    "New york city is a vibrant city filled with energetic people and visitors looking for new restaurants to try out. Our database will aid customers in the most efficient way when they have different questions about different restaurants. Some questions can find out about which restaurants provide vegan meals? With difficult parking in New York City, which restaurants provide parking? There are also tons of restaurants in New York City, which have high ratings and affordable menu prices? Alternatively, find all the restaurants that have an affordable price with their cuisine listed as well. Lastly, give the phone number to the restaurants that have deliveries. These are the five example questions customers might have in mind when using our database, and all of these can be answered efficiently."
